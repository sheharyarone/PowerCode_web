            When our solution fits, but there are not enough details, we start
            business analysis and create a PRD with functional and
            non-functional requirements and wireframes. Depending on the product
            specification, PRD may include diagrams, user story, role,
            permission, and/or risk matrix, etc.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            At this final stage of project estimation, we give our clients a
            full picture of their product development process, as detailed as it
            can be. The Product Requirements Document and product specification
            cover logic, functionality, design, and every other compound of both
            product and project
          </p>
        </li>
